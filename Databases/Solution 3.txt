- Database Normalization #1 - 1NF

The following unnormalized table named PRODUCT is transformed to first normal form (1NF) 
by splitting it into two tables which have X and Y rows (such that X <Y) respectively. 
Both the tables have Z columns.

*Product-ID*    *Colors*    *Price*
1               Red,Green   15.0
2               Blue        18.0
3               Yellow,Pink 2.5
What are the values of X, Y, Z?

=> 3,5,2

3 prices, 5 colors, 2 columns(product-id, colors/price)


- Database Normalization #2 - 1/2/3 NF

A particular database is normalized to satisfy a particular level of normalization (either 1NF or 2NF or 3NF). 
One of the tables contains, among other fields, a column for the City and a column for the Zip Code.
Assuming that there is a many-to-one mapping between the set of Zip Code(s) and City, 
we may conclude that the database is definitely NOT in NF form. 
What is the integer x (1, 2, or 3)? Fill your answer in the text box below.

=> 3
