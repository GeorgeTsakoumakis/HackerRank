#Day 3: Conditional Probability

Suppose a family has  children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

() 1 / 3
() 1 / 2
() 2 / 3
() 1 / 9

=> 
sample space = 36
Events that sum is over 9: A,B = ((4,6) (5,5) (5,6) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6))
calculation : 1 - 6/36 = 5/6

#Day 3: Cards of the Same Suit

In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

(X) 1 / 9
() 1 / 6
() 2 / 3
() 5 / 6

=> 
sample space = 36
Events that values are different and sum is 6: A,B = ((1,5) (2,4) (4,2) (5,1))
calculation : 4/36 = 1/9

#Day 3: Drawing Marbles

There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.


Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

() 10 / 63
() 2 / 7
(X) 17 / 42
() 31 / 126

=> 
sample space = 36
Events that 2 red balls and 1 black ball: X,Y,Z = ((r, r, b) (r, b, r) (b, r, r))
calculation : 
r,r,b = 4/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 10/63
r,b,r = 4/7 * 4/9 * 4/8 = 8/63
b,r,r = 3/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 5/42

sum of these probabilities = 51/126 = 17/42
