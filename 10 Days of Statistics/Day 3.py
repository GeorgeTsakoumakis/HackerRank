#Day 3: Conditional Probability

Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

(X) 1 / 3
() 1 / 2
() 2 / 3
() 1 / 9

=> 
P(BB|B) = BB/(BG+GB+BB)
We don't know which one is a boy yet

#Day 3: Cards of the Same Suit

You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

() 1 / 156
() 1 / 39
() 12 / 39
(X) 12 / 51

=> 
4 suilts are in the standard 52-card deck (13 each).

1. pick one of them(any of them is possible): 1
2. pick one another with the same suit: 12/51


#Day 3: Drawing Marbles

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

() 1 / 12
() 7 / 12
() 1 / 6
(X) 2 / 3

=>
simply the first marble was the red (probability = 3/7),
now 6 marbles are left in the bag.

The probability of drawing blue marbles in the bag = 4/6 = 2/3
